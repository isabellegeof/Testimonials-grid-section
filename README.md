## My process

I first thought of using Bootstrap with a grid nested inside another grid. But I had a hard time figuring out how to create the gap between the boxes. I watched a Youtube video and learned about the CSS grid which was much simpler to use! I started building the desktop version, but since it was more "complicated" than the mobile version, I ended up placing the specific desktop layout details inside a media query.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Media query

### What I learned

- CSS grid!!
- How to use an image in the background and all the background properties

### Continued development

This is what I would like to learn/improve:

- CSS grid and using grid areas
- Getting better with positioning elements in general

### Useful resources
